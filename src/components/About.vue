          Hello! I'm Renee, a Diploma of Website Development Student from TAFE
          SA. This is my folio of work completed as part of my project
          management and workplace project classes. In these subjects, we take
          on the roles of project managers in creating a product for a client.
          My client was the Playford Men's Shed, and the website I created can
          be found
